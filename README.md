Task-3 

for this task i choose to use if not exists condition in creating the table as i had already executed the query of create table.
this 5 column table.
1. few columns have different data type so i have defined the datatype while creating the columns.
2. NOT NULL is used because we need those columns to be filled anyhow.
3. Then, i have applied data manipulation techniques to insert the values to the table.
4. And then select * from employees; query is used to return the table created.
5. tried extracting the columns from the employees table
6. and then made queries to apply AND , OR, LIKE, BETWEEN and AND conditions.
